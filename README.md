# Vanilla Structures

*Created by [Th3Emilis](https://mcpedl.com/user/th3emilis/)*

Conveniently generate vanilla structures anywhere in your world!

## Getting started

Open the chat and type `/function vs/help` to get a list of the available commands to generate the structures. When you find what you are looking for, type the command as shown to generate the structure.

If you somehow get stuck after generating the structure, you may `/tp` away or change your `/gamemode` to `spectator` so that you do not damage the structure.

## Mirroring and rotation

If you wish to generate the structure mirrored or rotated, you may want to download the `struct` version of the add-on instead.

However, you can accomplish the same thing using the function-based version as well. Steps are as follows:  
1. Generate the structure as is in a flat open space.
2. Get yourself a structure block (`/give @s structure_block`) and save the structure by using its UI.
3. Load the structure wherever you want with the customised rotation, mirroring and integrity settings.
